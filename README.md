A basic simulation of people, their need for resources and interactions between them. The eventual aim is to be able to model emergent baheviours around obtaining resources via sharing, stealing, exploitation, etc.

People can pass on some resource-seeking behaviour traits to their progeny with some mutation. Eventually we'll also have a model where people can learn successful strategoes from other individuals or groups, align themselves with those groups, vote to change the rules.
